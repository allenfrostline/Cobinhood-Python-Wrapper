# Cobinhood Python Wrapper

[Cobinhood](http://cobinhood.com/) is a new cryptocurrency exchange based in Taiwan. Its API is yet under development but to start playing around it will never hurt. Since I'm most familiar with the API of Poloniex, my plan is to start from [this repo](https://github.com/s4w3d0ff/python-poloniex).
